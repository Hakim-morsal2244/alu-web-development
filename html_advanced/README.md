# Get Schooled Website

## Project Overview
The **Get Schooled** project focuses on creating the HTML structure of a website designed to promote education. This is based on a Figma design, with the goal of building a clean and accessible webpage using semantic HTML.

## Objectives
1. Create a well-structured webpage based on the Figma design file.
2. Use semantic HTML elements for better organization and accessibility.
